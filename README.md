# Emu War II

Inspired by the events of the Great Emu War of 1932, Emu War II by Mind Goblins Studios is set on a modern day Australian farm and explores the non-zero possibility of a second emu invasion. The game is a timed survival, resource management, tower defence game, where the player is armed with a Ute-mounted-turret and tasked with defending their farmhouse from an onslaught of pesky emus. Playing as the owner of a farm, ‘Big Davo’, your ute must be maneuverered around the farm to defeat the incoming waves of emus. The game is lost if too many emus enter the barn in the middle of the farm. The turret only has the power to fire when the Ute is parked, meaning the player will have to balance the need to stop and defeat enemies with the need to traverse the map, repositioning your turret whilst salvaging scrap for purchase upgrades for the turret to defeat the progressively stronger emus. The game is won if the player survives for five minutes.
